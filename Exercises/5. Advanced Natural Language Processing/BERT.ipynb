              "'\\'Tenet\\'s\\' rough start at the box office signals a bleak fall for US theaters New York (CNN Business)For American theaters, \"Tenet\" was supposed to be the film that brought audiences back to the movies. There was just one problem: \"Tenet\" opened, and hardly anyone showed up. Warner Bros.\\' new Christopher Nolan spy thriller has made roughly $30 million domestically since opening in North America two weeks ago. That includes two pretty lackluster weekends where the film made about $9.5 million and $6.7 million at the box office. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.) For Warner Bros., the news isn\\'t all bad since \"Tenet\" has performed admirably overseas. The film, which opened internationally in late August, has brought in more than $205 million globally so far. However, for domestic theaters, \"Tenet\\'s\" rough start puts a considerable strain on an industry that needed a blockbuster to entice moviegoers back to the cineplex.  \\'Beyond bleak\\' With no other big film on the schedule until at least November, US theaters are in for a dire fall season at the movies. \"There\\'s no way around this; the outlook for theaters over the next seven weeks is beyond bleak,\" Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations, told CNN Business. \"The totally bummer summer of 2020 is about to become the awful fall.\" Bock added that with no big films, theaters are \"basically left to fend for themselves booking library titles and alternate content.\"  \"This will not end well for chains or independent theaters, many of which will be operating at a loss. With no major blockbusters until November — although those aren\\'t remotely set in stone — theaters will likely have to make the unfortunate choice of shutting down again or limiting their operating hours.\"  Other films in theaters like \"Unhinged\" and \"The New Mutants\" have also not found an audience, which led to a dismal box office this past weekend. This weekend\\'s domestic box office brought in just $15 million, a number that is \"not enough to cover operating expenses,\" according to IndieWire\\'s Tom Brueggemann. \"[Theaters] have staff and other operational costs to pay, as well as rent to landlords. Theaters have a stronger hand in negotiating rent if they\\'re closed,\" Brueggemann wrote. \"Once open, they owe, and now they face weeks of operation at a significant loss.\" So is there any hope on the near horizon for theaters? Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, believes that if significant markets like New York City and Los Angeles open, the industry could see a much-needed boost. \"The presence of those open markets certainly wouldn\\'t hurt,\" Robbins said. \"Combined, they contribute 10% to 15% of an average mainstream film\\'s domestic box office. Based solely on \"Tenet\\'s\" performance thus far, those markets alone aren\\'t going to immediately normalize box office revenue. What they can do, however, is galvanize the perception of reopenings.\"  Robbins noted that theaters are relying \"largely on word of mouth from suburbs and urban areas to convey the safety and availability of going back to the cinemas.\" However, there are no promises that even if those cities open theaters that audiences will want to return, Bock said.  \"Opening NYC and LA will provide a small boost, but it\\'s doubtful that it would heal the box office wound that COVID has inflicted,\" he said. What about streaming? Then there\\'s the streaming option. Following Disney\\'s decision to release \"Mulan\" on Disney+, studios could decide that it\\'s less risky to release a film digitally than in theaters right now. \"There\\'s no way around streaming right now in North America,\" Bock said. \"This isn\\'t a solution that will be set in stone going forward, but it is the best solution for the reality of right now.\" With streaming numbers kept close to the vest, it\\'s difficult to gauge the effect that digital releases can have on a film\\'s bottom line, but Bock believes streaming can work in line with theaters, at least for the time being. \"Studios need to offer other alternatives right now,\" he said. \"In the rest of the world, studios may be able to get away with a traditional release, but domestically, we\\'re in a funk, and reaching potential consumers will be all about delivering content in the safest and most efficient way possible. That\\'s [premium video on demand]. Or a combination of PVOD and theatrical.\" Nothing major is coming to theaters Yet, with no major releases for weeks, the industry finds itself looking toward November when \"No Time to Die,\" the latest James Bond film, is set to open. After that, the highly anticipated and often delayed \"Wonder Woman 1984\" highlights the holiday season opening on Christmas. Late October does have two films set to open in theaters with \"Death on the Nile\" from 20th Century Studios and Sony Animation\\'s \"Connected,\" but those films aren\\'t on the level of the franchise films opening in November and December. \"Black Widow,\" the new film from Marvel Studios, was set to open on November 6, but Variety reported on Tuesday that Disney may delay that film as well. And even if any of films choose to stay in theaters, rather than following Mulan\\'s lead by heading to digital, it would still be an uphill battle to find audiences after months of theaters reeling and a still ongoing pandemic in the United States.  However, if theaters were going to mount any comeback, it could do worse than movies starring James Bond, and Wonder Woman.  '"

            "Label: health , Text: AstraZeneca's Oxford vaccine trial to resume, the university says  (CNN)The AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial, halted last week after an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers, will resume, the University of Oxford announced Saturday. The university, which is developing the vaccine with AstraZeneca, did not say when the trial would resume. AstraZeneca said the trial will only resume in the United Kingdom, adding that it's working with health authorities across the world to determine when other trials can resume.  Before the pause, the company was testing its vaccine, dubbed the Oxford vaccine, in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa. The university said in a statement that some 18,000 individuals around the world have received study vaccines as part of the trial. \"In large trials such as this, it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety,\" the statement added. US National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told a Senate hearing Wednesday that pausing a trial was a standard precaution that is meant to ensure experimental vaccines don't cause serious reactions among participants. \"To have a clinical hold, as has been placed on AstraZeneca, as of yesterday, because of a single serious adverse event, is not at all unprecedented,\" Collins said at a hearing of the Senate Heath, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. The companies promised to wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely. AstraZeneca did not provide any details on the issue that caused the trial to stop. While AstraZeneca didn't specify what the issue was, at the hearing on Wednesday Collins said the AstraZeneca hold was due to a \"spinal cord problem.\" On Wednesday, AstraZeneca issued a statement denying news reports that suggested the trial was stopped because of a case of transverse myelitis -- a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord. On the same day, AstraZeneca said it had paused its coronavirus vaccine trial not once but twice because of adverse events.  \"We can also confirm that there was a brief trial pause in July while a safety review took place after one volunteer was confirmed to have an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which the independent panel concluded was unrelated to the vaccine,\" a company spokesperson said. The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the US. It has the backing of the US federal government. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTec are the other two groups with Phase 3 trials under way, also with federal government funding.  \n",
            "Label: politics , Text: Trump team tries to keep debate fight going but others move on Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's reelection campaign on Sunday revived its push for an in-person presidential debate even though it seems the Joe Biden campaign -- and the debate commission -- have moved on. The move comes after Trump -- who has repeatedly flouted best public health practices since his Covid-19 diagnosis -- declined last week to participate in a virtual format. The latest effort from senior campaign surrogates and West Wing staff comes after the White House physician cleared Trump to resume public activity, but declined to say when the President's last negative test took place.  \"The President is ready to debate and his doctors have cleared him for participating in public engagements,\" White House deputy communications director Brian Morgenstern told reporters at the White House Sunday. \"They've said he's no longer a risk for transmission so it would be nice if the commission would get the debate back on the schedule.\" With the backing of their health advisers, the commission had announced Thursday morning that -- because Trump had recently tested positive for Covid-19 -- the debate that was scheduled for Miami this week would be held virtually, with the two candidates appearing from remote locations.  But Trump swiftly rejected that plan, saying he would not show up. As a result, the President's campaign and Biden's campaign have scrambled to set up dueling town hall events in recent days as a way to still reach voters in the final stretch of the election.  Biden is set to participate in a town hall on ABC, moderated by George Stephanopoulos, Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. The former vice president's campaign and ABC announced the event the same day that the commission said the second debate would be virtual, and have made their commitment to the network town hall known even as the Trump campaign has pushed for a new debate schedule.  Trump's team, meanwhile, is in talks with NBC about a town hall, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning. The event is conditioned on the President testing negative for the coronavirus, the sources said. That town hall will likely be in an outdoor setting in Miami, just like the one NBC recently hosted with Biden, the sources added. But even as the Trump campaign plans for a network town hall event, campaign surrogates continue to mount a forceful push for an in-person debate.  The President's son, Eric Trump, echoed his father's push to reschedule, saying on ABC's \"This Week\" that his father \"wants to stand on the stage with his opponent.\"  And Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, praised the President \"for saying no,\" telling Fox News on Sunday, \"I think a virtual debate is an absolute disaster.\" The last-minute push for an in-person debate reflects the mounting risk of Trump's decision to walk away from the virtual debate at a time when his campaign is trailing in national polls and in a number of key swing states with a little more than three weeks to go until Election Day. The Commission on Presidential Debates did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Sunday.  The commission's decision to cancel the second Trump-Biden contest of the cycle was the culmination of a furious 48-hour back-and-forth between the commission and both Trump's and Biden's campaigns. \"It is now apparent there will be no debate on October 15, and the CPD will turn its attention to preparations for the final presidential debate scheduled for October 22,\" the commission said in a statement on Friday.  The President has repeatedly signaled that he is ready to put his bout with coronavirus behind him and return to the campaign trail, despite little clarity about his condition, no independent view of his physical state and warnings from health experts he could still be shedding the virus. He even told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that it \"seems like I'm immune\" despite there being no evidence that people are immune if they have been infected once and the US Centers for Disease Control and Protection specifically cautioning people not to assume they are immune. Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" Sunday that \"we are not going to let Donald Trump whipsaw around at the last second trying to rewrite the rules.\" Trump, she said, \"doesn't get to set the calendar.\" \"The debate commission sets the calendar. We all agreed to these debates back in June, and we're not going to let him try to rewrite the rules at the last second.\" The commission's October 22 debate is set to be held in Nashville and will likely be the final meeting between the two candidates before Election Day.

            "Label: politics , Text: Fact check: Trump campaign posts another dishonestly snipped Biden quote to make him sound confused Washington (CNN)There is a pattern: President Donald Trump's campaign and its allies keep dishonestly snipping, editing or describing video clips of former Vice President Joe Biden to try to make the Democratic presidential nominee seem confused or senile. They did it again early this week. On Tuesday morning, the Trump campaign posted an eight-second video on Facebook that it titled \"Joe Biden completely botches the Pledge of Allegiance.\" It was the same clip that was tweeted on Monday, with the same caption, by Republican National Committee rapid response director Steve Guest; Guest's tweet generated more than 13,500 retweets, at least 1.5 million video views and numerous comments questioning Biden's mental acuity.  The clip shows Biden saying this: \"I pledge allegiance to the United States of America. One nation, indivisible, under God. For real.\" If that was indeed Biden's attempt to recite the entire 31-word Pledge of Allegiance, it would indeed be wrong. But it wasn't. Facts First: Biden was not trying to recite the entire Pledge of Allegiance when he said these words. He was referring, more than 22 minutes into a campaign speech, to particular phrases in the pledge -- to make a point about how he would not divide the country between \"red states\" and \"blue states\" as Trump does. Biden made the remark in a campaign speech Monday in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in which he castigated Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. At this particular moment, Biden was criticizing Trump's comments about how the US's coronavirus death statistics would supposedly look good if you didn't count the deaths in \"blue states.\" Biden correctly pointed out that even counting only the deaths in states Trump won in 2016 would give the US the second-highest total in the world, behind Brazil. Biden then argued that Trump has a \"deeply flawed and divisive view of the United States, this nation and the job he holds.\" \"Think about what he's saying,\" Biden said. \"He's saying if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you're not his problem. He has no obligation to you. He's not responsible for you as President, your family or your well-being. I don't see the presidency that way. I don't pledge allegiance to red states of America or blue states of America. I pledge allegiance to the United States of America. One nation, indivisible, under God. For real. I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm not going to govern as a Democratic president: I'm going to govern as president.\" It's entirely clear in context that Biden was not trying to recite the whole pledge here. For the record, the whole pledge reads as follows: \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"  \n",
            "Label: politics , Text: McConnell calls Barrett 'exceedingly well-qualified' and vows Senate floor vote 'in the weeks ahead' Washington (CNN)Top Senate Republicans applauded President Donald Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to become the next Supreme Court justice and called for a quick confirmation vote, while Democrats slammed the move as a power grab that threatens to undermine the legacy of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The sharp partisan divide sets the stage for a brutal and high-stakes confirmation fight in a bitterly-divided Senate to fill the vacancy left by Ginsburg's death.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Barrett \"exceedingly well-qualified\" and an \"exceptionally impressive jurist\" in a statement and reiterated his vow for the Senate to hold a vote on the nomination, saying it will take place \"in the weeks ahead.\" Senate Republicans, who have the majority in the chamber, had already signaled plans to quickly move to take up the nomination even before Trump nominated Barrett.  Democrats, in the minority in the Senate, have few options at their disposal to push back, but are nevertheless gearing up for a fight and the drive to install a new justice is sure to create an intense liberal backlash, which could have dramatic implications for the fight for Congress and the White House this year. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Saturday that he will \"strongly oppose\" the nomination. \"Justice Ginsburg's dying wish was that she not be replaced until a new president is installed,\" Schumer said, adding, \"Republicans are poised to not only ignore her wishes, but to replace her with someone who could tear down everything that she built. This reprehensible power grab is a cynical attack on the legitimacy of the Court.\" Barrett's confirmation hearing will begin October 12, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham announced Saturday. The hearing will last three to four days, with questioning of Barrett scheduled to start on Tuesday, October 13, Graham said. Graham told Fox News that he hopes Barrett will clear a committee vote by October 26, likely teeing up a Senate floor vote shortly before Election Day. The push to confirm a Supreme Court justice ahead of the election would put the Senate on track for one of the quickest confirmations in modern history. No Supreme Court nominee has ever been confirmed after the month of July during a presidential election year. Trump said Saturday evening he thinks Barrett will be confirmed in short order.  \"I think it's gonna go quickly, I hope,\" Trump told reporters before departing the White House shortly after the nomination announcement for a rally in Pennsylvania. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of Senate Republican leadership, said in a statement that the Senate \"will give Judge Barrett full and fair consideration, and a timely vote on the Senate floor.\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican facing a competitive reelection, praised Trump's selection, calling Barrett \"highly qualified in all the areas that matter\" in a statement and saying that he is \"committed to ensuring that the nominee gets a challenging, fair, and respectful hearing.\"  Top Democrats, including Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned on Saturday that the nomination could jeopardize access to health care and threaten other consequential policy issues that could come before the high court. The court is scheduled to hear arguments on the future of the Affordable Care Act a week after Election Day.  In a statement, Schumer said, \"The American people should make no mistake—a vote by any Senator for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.\" Pelosi echoed that message, saying, \"For four years, President Trump has tried to crush the Affordable Care Act in the Congress and the Courts. This nomination threatens the destruction of life-saving protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions together with every other benefit and protection of the Affordable Care Act.\" In an indication of how united Democrats are in opposition to the nomination, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the lone Democrat to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018, said he would not support Barrett before the election.  \"Rushing to confirm a Supreme Court nominee weeks before a presidential election has never been done before in the history of our nation and it will only fan the flames of division at a time when our country is deeply divided. I cannot support a process that risks further division of the American people at a time when we desperately need to come together. I will not vote to confirm Judge Coney Barrett or any Supreme Court nominee before Election Day on November 3rd,\" he said. Currently, there are 53 GOP senators, meaning Republicans can only lose three votes to advance the nomination if Vice President Mike Pence steps in to cast a tie-breaking vote. Ahead of the President's announcement, only two Republicans -- Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins, who is facing a competitive reelection fight in Maine -- had voiced opposition to the possibility of taking up a nominee before November 3. After Trump's Saturday announcement, Murkowski said in a statement that she would meet with Barrett.  \"For weeks I have stated that I do not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to an election. But today the President exercised his constitutional authority to nominate an individual to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I welcome the opportunity to meet with the Supreme Court nominee, just as I did in 2016.\" GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a frequent critic of the President, signaled earlier this week that he is on board with the Senate taking up a Supreme Court nomination during the current election year, an announcement that all but ensured a nominee could be confirmed, barring any potential missteps by the nominee during the confirmation process. Romney praised Barrett's nomination in a statement on Saturday, calling her a \"highly-respected jurist with distinguished legal and academic credentials.\" The Utah Republican said, \"I look forward to meeting with Judge Barrett, reviewing her record thoroughly, and carefully evaluating her qualifications.\" This story has been updated with additional developments.

            "Label: politics , Text: With an eye on a tight Florida race, Trump announces new restrictions on Cuban hotels, cigars and rum  (CNN)President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a new series of economic sanctions on Cuba that ban US citizens from buying Cuban cigars as well as rum and staying at Cuban government-owned hotels on the communist-run island.   \"Today, as part of our continuing fight against communist oppression, I am announcing that the Treasury Department will prohibit US travelers from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government,\" Trump said at a White House event honoring Bay of Pigs veterans. \"We're also further restricting the importation of Cuban alcohol and Cuban tobacco.\"  \"These actions will ensure that US dollars do not fund the Cuban regime and go directly to the Cuban people,\" the President asserted.  The announcement seemed to be a clear attempt to appeal to Cuban-American voters in Florida, which is seen by many analysts as a must-win state for Trump if he is to be reelected in November.  On Wednesday, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll had Trump at 51% over Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden 47% among likely voters in the state, a result within the margin of error.  The administration is also eliminating general authorizations for US citizens to travel to Cuba for sporting events, performances or professional meetings and conferences. Now US citizens wanting to travel to Cuba for those activities will need to apply for a specific license, according to a statement from the US Treasury Department.   Last year the State Department provided a list of restricted entities, including hotels, that the US said are \"under the control of, or acting for or on behalf of, the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel with which direct financial transactions would disproportionately benefit such services or personnel at the expense of the Cuban people or private enterprise in Cuba.\"  The increased sanctions further chip away at the warming of relations enacted by the Obama administration with Cuba, one of former President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy initiatives.   During his announcement of the Cuba restrictions, the President also said, \"We're also imposing strict sanctions on the dictatorships of Nicaragua and Venezuela. We brought criminal charges against Maduro for his narcoterrorism.\" It's not clear whether Trump was announcing additional sanctions against the two countries or highlighting previous administration moves.  In a conference call with reporters, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Cuba and Venezuela Carrie Filipetti said the new measures were designed to encourage Americans legally visiting Cuba to stay in small bed and breakfasts run by regular Cuban citizens rather than government-run hotels.  \"These are some of the ordinary Cubans the administration's policies seek to lift up,\" she said.  The Trump administration had identified 433 hotels and properties that Americans will no longer be able to stay at in Cuba, Filipetti said.  Filipetti denied the new sanctions announced so close to the November election had anything to do with currying favor with conservative Cuban-American voters. \"There is no nexus to any domestic issue,\" she said.  The announcement is unlikely to have an immediate impact on Cuba's economy as the Cuban government closed borders nearly six months ago and all commercial flights from the US have been suspended as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.     Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, Cuba's top diplomat for US affairs, blasted the sanctions, writing on Twitter, \"Shocked and disappointed by the strength of the revolution despite its brutal economic war, the US government has adopted new aggressive measures that will restrict even more the rights of US citizens.\"    \n",
            "Label: politics , Text: Trump takes his Covid misinformation machine back on the road  (CNN)President Donald Trump takes his Covid denial tour back to the campaign trail Monday as the tense final stretch of an election now three weeks away gets a fresh jolt with Senate hearings on his Supreme Court pick Amy Coney Barrett. Trump, who announced Sunday, without providing evidence, that he has tested \"totally negative\" after his bout with the virus, plans to hold his first rally since his diagnosis was publicly disclosed, in Florida, in what risks turning into yet another super spreader event. \"I'm immune. So, the President is in very good shape to fight the battles,\" Trump said on Fox's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" in comments that misrepresented his own capacity to spread the virus if he is exposed to it again. A tweet along the same lines earned a warning from Twitter that the President was spreading misleading information about the virus. The President's proclamations about his own health followed another opaque memo from his physician, who cleared Trump to end isolation but who hasn't taken reporters' questions in a week. Trump's Monday rally and subsequent events this week in Pennsylvania, Iowa and North Carolina will underscore both his increasing concern about his own prospects, as time to rescue his presidency runs out, and how his own infection with Covid-19 has done nothing to convince him to adopt a more responsible attitude toward the pandemic.  He heads to Florida after University of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Mike Osterholm warned Friday on CNN that the Sunshine State could soon be like a \"house on fire\" after dropping most precautions needed to quell the spread of the virus. The state added 5,000 new cases over the weekend. Trump's rallies are habitually packed and feature little mask wearing in violation of his own government's guidelines. At least nine people who attended a Trump rally in Minnesota last month have tested positive. Further underscoring how Trump puts his own political goals ahead of his duty to lead the emergency response, Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday objected to being misrepresented by a Trump campaign ad hailing the President's pandemic leadership. The ad creates a false impression that Trump's handling of a virus that has killed 214,000 Americans has been a famous success, and features Fauci saying, \"I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more.\" The government's top infectious disease specialist told CNN that the comments, which were made during a March Fox News interview, were used without his permission and were ripped out of context. \"In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,\" Fauci told CNN.  But Trump, who has consistently marginalized public health officials who advocate science-based approaches to the pandemic, shot Fauci down in a tweet in an apparent attempt to mitigate public dissatisfaction with his own leadership. His handling of the pandemic appears to be driving his poor performance in polls in an election that's already underway. Democratic nominee Joe Biden is ahead by 11 points in CNN's Poll of Polls as of Sunday, while more than 7 million Americans have already voted. \"They are indeed Dr. Fauci's own words. We have done a 'phenomenal' job, according to certain governors. Many people agree...And now come the Vaccines & Cures, long ahead of projections!\" Trump tweeted. Alarming virus data The President's new attempt to create an alternative reality about a pandemic that he first ignored, then downplayed and ultimately mismanaged, comes as experts warn of a dire fall and winter ahead. The virus is now trending up in 31 states and is receding in only three, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Saturday alone, there were more than 54,000 new infections recorded with a further 618 deaths. The high baseline of cases means that a coming spike could be even more serious than the viral storm that raged through the northeast and the south in the spring and summer. The latest forecast from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine projects that there could be nearly 395,000 US coronavirus deaths by February 1. In a tweet on Monday morning, Trump minimized the threat and gloated over a rise in cases in European nations that did a better job of suppressing the virus than the US and did enjoy something of a respite over the summer but are seeing the pandemic return with a vengeance now. \"Big spike in the China Plague in Europe and other places that the Fake News used to hold up as examples of places that are doing well, in order to make the U.S. look bad. Be strong and vigilant, it will run its course. Vaccines and cures are coming fast!\" Trump tweeted. In a volley of appearances with conservative media late last week and over the weekend, Trump pressed home his false narrative about the crisis. Two weeks after holding a superspreader White House event to highlight the Barrett nomination, Trump held forth to a crowd of hundreds on the South Lawn on Saturday. \"It's going to disappear, it is disappearing and vaccines are going to help,\" Trump said.  Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, also painted a false picture of the situation on Sunday. \"We are learning to deal with the virus in a targeted, safe, preventive way,\" Kudlow told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" while promoting a new call for an economic stimulus package that has already been rejected by House Democrats and a group of Senate Republicans. Trump's experience with the virus -- albeit with emergency therapies not available to other Americans -- has played into his conceit that it is not that serious and that it should not \"dominate\" regular life. While the overwhelming majority of those infected will get better, the disease has been fatal for several hundred thousand Americans and caused complications for many others. The President's prescription for getting back to normal -- encapsulated by a lack of mask wearing and social distancing at his rallies -- not only risks infecting tens of thousands in the coming months. It also threatens to overwhelm hospitals again and therefore to leave many victims without proper treatment. Tough polls for Trump  The President's return to the campaign trail is being driven by necessity. Multiple national polls have him falling further behind Biden nationally and in swing states following his boorish performance in the first debate and his own diagnosis with the disease, which has deepened public perceptions that he has botched the crisis.  A Washington Post/ABC News poll Sunday showed Biden at 54% among likely voters nationally and Trump at 42%. It was the latest survey to show the Democratic nominee with a double-digit lead. CBS polls of Michigan and Nevada showed Biden up 6 points in each state. And the rivals are tied at 49% in Iowa -- a state Trump had expected to not have to worry about. In the ABC/Washington Post poll, nearly 6 in 10 people disapprove of the way the President is handling the pandemic. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Trump will hit the road after the White House physician, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley, issued a statement on Saturday night that said the President was \"no longer considered a transmission risk to others,\" although it didn't say he had tested negative. The White House is also still refusing to say when the President last posted a negative test before he got sick -- information that would help establish whether he knowingly traveled to campaign events without precautions to safeguard others while contagious. Biden used a campaign swing through Pennsylvania on Saturday -- a state that Trump won in 2016 but where the Democrat is currently leading -- to try to win over disaffected Republicans and independents. \"I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I am going to govern as an American president,\" Biden said, touting the endorsement of the Keystone State's popular former Republican Gov. Tom Ridge. \"I am going to work as hard for those who don't support me as those who do,\" he said. Barrett hearing will reverberate through election campaign  Republicans hope Barrett's confirmation hearings, which begin in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, will supercharge base turnout in three weeks and compensate for the President's dipping poll numbers. The hearings will be an important moment for Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican facing an unexpectedly tough reelection. Democrat Jaime Harrison announced on Sunday that he had raised $57 million between July 1 and the end of September, shattering the quarterly fundraising record for a Senate candidate. Democrats accuse Republicans of stealing the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, ushering in an unassailable conservative majority. And they say Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is guilty of hypocrisy after pressing ahead despite refusing to confirm President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland in an election year. Democrats are demanding that Barrett recuse herself from any cases that arise out of an election that Trump appears determined to dispute. On the eve of the hearings, they talked up the possibility that Barrett could vote to overturn the Affordable Care Act with the court due to hear a case on the administration's bid to finally kill the law the week after the election. \"This nominee poses a clear and present danger,\" Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said on \"State of the Union.\" \"The immediate danger is to the health care of over 20 million Americans who have health care thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the over 100 million Americans who are protected under the Affordable Care Act because they have preexisting conditions, not to mention the seven million who have tested positive for Covid, who will be put into the category of those with preexisting conditions.\"  \n",
            "Label: politics , Text: 5 takeaways from Monday's Senate hearing on Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett  (CNN)The first day of confirmation hearings for President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett featured plenty of fiery speeches -- many of them aimed at next month's presidential election rather than the nominee herself. Democrats focused more on the Affordable Care Act, and Trump's backing of a lawsuit that would invalidate the law -- a hearing scheduled for November 10. Republicans defended the decision to confirm Barrett so close to the election and sought to preempt any questions about her Catholic faith, mainly by criticizing Democratic comments from 2017. In fact, viewers might be forgiven if they forgot at times that this was a Supreme Court confirmation rather than a political convention. Here are five takeaways from day one of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings: It's all over but the politicking Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham acknowledged the elephant in the room at the outset of a four-day confirmation hearing process: Nobody's mind on the committee is going to be changed by what transpires in the Senate hearing room. \"This is probably not about persuading each other, unless something really dramatic happens,\" Graham said. \"All Republicans will vote yes, and all Democrats will vote no.\" As a result, both sides have a clear eye to the election three weeks away as they debate the Supreme Court nominee -- and as they will question Barrett over the next two days. Four Republicans on the committee, including Graham, are up for reelection next month. And Sen. Kamala Harris of California is the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Democrats put their clear focus on the threat Obamacare faces when a Republican-led, and Trump-backed, case to strike it down goes before the Supreme Court just a week after the election. The message that health care was at risk for millions of Americans was one that helped Democrats win over voters during the 2018 election and take back the House. Republicans, meanwhile, went after Democrats for attacks on Barrett, and in particular her faith -- while frequently citing the bitter 2018 fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, which helped Republicans in several 2018 Senate contests in red states. \"We all watched the hearings for Justice Kavanaugh,\" said Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. \"It was a freak show. It looked like the Cantina Bar scene out of Star Wars.\"  Dems make a personal pitch to protect health care Democrats showed a united front and an organized, perhaps surprising, message with posters scattered across their half of the dais showing the faces of people who relied on the Affordable Care Act for their health care. A Democratic committee aide said the decision to use personal stories stemmed from an effort to to make Barrett's confirmation as tangible to people as possible that focused on \"the real-life effects of a Justice Barrett's decisions.\" Democrats feel the health care angle, stressing Trump's efforts and the impact of gutting Obamacare, is a clear political winner. Democratic leaders, including presidential nominee Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed on the strategy, according to sources familiar with the discussions. \"They are trying to get a justice onto the Court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections in the Affordable Care Act,\" Harris said of Republicans. \"If they succeed, it will result in millions of people losing access to health care at the worst possible time in the middle of a pandemic.\" Democrats also used their health care argument to hit Trump on the Covid-19 pandemic, another key Democratic message heading into the November election. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota made a personal appeal after her husband tested positive for coronavirus earlier this year. \"He ended up in the hospital for a week on oxygen with severe pneumonia, and months after he got it, I find out the President knew it was airborne but he didn't tell us,\" Klobuchar said. Asked about the Democrats' unity after the hearing, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin responded: \"It's a bit surprising yeah?\" Republicans look for openings to discuss religion Republicans in their opening statements criticized Democrats for previous questions about Barrett's Catholic faith and for stories about her association with the Christian group People of Praise.  \"There are places where this committee has acted like it's the job of the committee to delve into people's religious communities. That's nuts,\" said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican. At Monday's hearing, however, it was only the Republicans, not Democrats, discussing religion. Barrett also nodded to her religion in her opening statement, saying she believes in the power of prayer. Still, Republicans had plenty of fodder from past hearings to knock Democrats over, including Barrett's 2017 confirmation hearing for the federal appeals court, such as when the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, said, \"the dogma lives loudly within you.\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, accused Democrats of a \"pattern and practice of religious bigotry.\"  The criticisms tied to faith were more about the two days of questions to follow than the opening day speeches, as Democrats are likely to press Barrett on Roe v. Wade and other abortion cases. Hawley criticized Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, for saying a previous Supreme Court case, Griswold v. Connecticut, which allowed married couples the right to obtain and use contraception, was in danger of being struck down. Hawley claimed that the reference was \"another hit at Judge Barrett's religious faith, referring to Catholic doctrinal beliefs.\" But it's a case that has been raised repeatedly at judicial confirmation hearings. Covid looms over hearing  Three Republican senators have tested positive for coronavirus over the past two weeks, throwing into doubt what appeared to be a sure-thing confirmation.  That danger for Republicans appears to have passed, for now, but the coronavirus threat still loomed over the hearing, as two of the Republicans who tested positive are on the Judiciary Committee. One of those senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, spoke remotely at Monday's hearing. He has said he expects to be there in person on Tuesday. The other senator who tested positive, Mike Lee of Utah, appeared in person on Monday, saying he had been cleared by his doctor to attend. Democrats attacked Graham for moving forward with the hearing despite the positive tests -- and not requiring tests for all senators on the panel. \"This hearing itself is a microcosm of Trump's dangerous ineptitude in dealing with the Covid pandemic,\" charged Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat. Graham defended the hearing, saying that strict health protocols were being followed, arguing he was going to work to do his job just like millions of Americans. The setting meant no members of the public could attend, a break from normal confirmation hearings, and senators were spread out across the cavernous hearing room. The pandemic-era hearing also meant one other notable distention: Barrett was wearing a black mask throughout the senators' opening statements. Other Supreme Court nominees have needed to keep a straight face while they are often attacked, but Barrett's expressions were masked. Barrett emphasizes experience with Scalia Monday's hearing ended with Barrett's own opening statement, where she discussed clerking for the late Justice Antonin Scalia and what her background would bring to the court, including that she would be the first mother of school-aged children to be a justice and the only sitting justice who didn't graduate from Harvard or Yale Law School. Barrett generally discussed her legal philosophy, which reflects that of Scalia, her mentor and a conservative anchor of the high court for years. \"The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people,\" Barrett said. She also touched on the discussion surrounding her religion at the conclusion of her statement. \"I believe in the power of prayer, and it has been uplifting to hear that so many people are praying for me,\" Barrett said. Monday's hearing was a day of scripted rhetoric with speeches from senators and the nominee. The real action begins Tuesday with questions. Senators will each get a half-hour to question Barrett on Tuesday and Wednesday, with Republicans and Democrats alternating turns. Then they will get another 20 minutes for a second round. With 22 senators on the panel, both days will go into the evening, representing Barrett's toughest test before her confirmation to the high court. CNN's Lauren Fox, Clare Foran and Manu Raju contributed to this report. \n",
            "Label: politics , Text: Weekly White House task force reports reflect mixed messages on masks  (CNN)The White House task force applauded statewide mask usage in Arkansas, Kentucky and Nevada, but a review of the most recent weekly state reports since June shows that the task force has gradually backed off once-dire mask recommendations for the state of Georgia. The reports come as President Donald Trump directly contradicted US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield, further muddling the mask messaging. CNN reached out to all 50 states for their weekly task force reports, which the White House has declined to make public, and had obtained responses from 15 states as of Thursday.  Many states are showing improvements in new cases and test positivity, the September 13 reports showed. The reports place states into three \"zones\" for cases: red zone indicating 100 new cases per 100,000 population in the last week, yellow zone indicating between 10 and 100 new cases per 100,000 population and green zone indicating fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 population. The reports also place states into three zones for test positivity: red zone indicating more than 10% test positivity, yellow zone indicating between 5% and 10% test positivity and green zone indicating less than 5% test positivity. Of the reports CNN has received, cases have decreased or been stable in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Nevada, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont and Washington. Cases have increased in Delaware and Wisconsin. Key takeaways from each state that has responded are below, in alphabetical order: Arkansas Arkansas remains in the \"red zone\" for cases, the eighth highest in the country, and the \"yellow zone\" for test positivity but has seen a decrease in both new cases and test positivity over the last week. The report \"(applauds) Arkansans' mask usage statewide\" and recommends the close tracking of test positivity. It indicates concerns with a \"high percent of nursing homes with staff and residents who have been recently diagnosed with COVID-19.\" The report also suggests that hospitals may be underestimating Covid-19-related hospitalizations. \"Underreporting may lead to a lower allocation of critical supplies,\" the task force warned. Colorado Colorado is in the yellow zone for new cases and the green zone for test positivity this week, stable over the past week, the task force report shows. \"Colorado continues to show consistent progress in containing the epidemic,\" the report says. However, the state has seen outbreaks at institutions of higher learning, including a fraternity at Colorado State University and a sorority at University of Colorado-Boulder. The task force reiterated recommendations for colleges and universities, including increasing testing, a plan for rapid testing and contact tracing, and rapid isolation of confirmed cases and contacts. The report also warns the state that hospitals may be underreporting coronavirus hospitalizations. Delaware Delaware is in the yellow zone for cases and the green zone for test positivity. The state has \"seen an increase in new cases for a second week\" and test positivity stability, the task force says. The task force reiterates its recommendations for universities and notes that cases at the University of Delaware have \"sharply increased,\" \"representing approximately 10% of the state total.\" The report also warns the state that hospitals may be underreporting coronavirus hospitalizations. Georgia Georgia is in the red zone for cases and the yellow zone for test positivity, with the task force praising \"progress with decreasing cases and test positivity week over week.\" \"Over the past five weeks, Georgia has decreased the number of red counties from 109 to 47 last week,\" the report says. The task force has backed off a mask mandate recommendation for the state in reports over the weeks. Georgia is one of several states that do not have statewide mask mandates.  A June 29 report recommended Georgia \"ensure public use of masks in all current and evolving hot spots.\" On July 26, the task force recommended the state \"Mandate use of masks in all current and evolving hot spots -- optimally a statewide mandate.\" Then an August 9 report was more dire: \"Current mitigation efforts are not having a sufficient impact and would strongly recommend a statewide mask mandate.\"  Reports obtained by CNN over the past three weeks have widely toned down that language and suggested mask or face coverings be worn in nursing homes and in college towns. The only mention of masks in the September 13 report was directed at students: \"Ensure protection of local communities through strict mask wearing and social distancing when off campus and when around vulnerable individuals on campus.\" The report also urges the state to increase testing capacity \"in preparation for fall\" and suggests that hospitals may be underestimating Covid-19-related hospitalizations. Illinois Illinois is in the yellow zone for cases and for test positivity, showing a decrease in new cases and test positivity stability over the last week, according to the report. The report says there have been \"significant declines\" in cases and test positivity at Illinois State University and declining cases at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The report reiterated its recommendations to universities. The report also suggests that hospitals may be underestimating Covid-19-related hospitalizations. Kansas Kansas is in the red zone with the 10th highest case rate in the country and the yellow zone for test positivity, the eighth highest in the country, according to the task force report. Both cases and test positivity have decreased over the last week. The task force notes that despite those decreases, \"there are more counties with ongoing moderate or high levels of transmission.\" In counties with high levels of transmission, the report says, \"use standard metrics to determine school learning options and capacity limits for bars and indoor dining.\" The report also suggests that hospitals may be underestimating Covid-19-related hospitalizations. Kentucky Kentucky is in the yellow zone for cases and test positivity, both of which have decreased over the last week. The task force \"(applauds) Kentuckians on their mask usage and all their efforts to decrease the spread of COVID-19 statewide,\" and encourages the state to use metrics in areas with high transmission to \"determine school learning options and capacity limits for bars and indoor dining.\" The report also raises concerns with a \"high percent of nursing homes with staff and residents who have COVID-19.\" Ohio Ohio is in the yellow zone for cases and the green zone for test positivity this week, with a decrease in new cases and stability for test positivity. The report says the state has made \"excellent progress,\" with the exception of Franklin County, which includes the Columbus metro area and The Ohio State University. OSU needs to expand testing \"to find asymptomatic students,\" the report says, adding in another recommendation that the state \"consider a further decrease in hours and occupancy limits in bars and restaurants in university counties and anywhere university and college students gather if cases continue to rise.\" Nevada Nevada is in the yellow zone for cases and test positivity, and has seen a decrease in both over the last week. Trump traveled to two of the counties with the highest rates of transmission earlier this week: Clark County, where he held an indoor rally in Henderson, and Washoe County, where he rallied outdoors in Reno. Few of his supporters wore masks.  Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services \"is encouraging all those who have attended a large gathering to be tested for COVID-19,\" public information officer Shannon Litz told CNN. \"As always, social distancing, wearing face coverings and good hand hygiene are key to slowing the spread of the virus.\" The task force report \"(applauds) Nevadans on mask usage and all their efforts to decrease the spread of COVID-19 statewide.\" North Dakota North Dakota is in the red zone for cases, which the task force attributes to \"aggressive testing\" finding asymptomatic cases among young people. It is in the yellow zone for test positivity. The state has seen stability in new cases and increasing test positivity over the last week, per the report. \"University student surges into small towns also is significantly increasing the cases per 100,000 population,\" the task force says, though notes the state is \"making progress.\" The task force recommends the state \"(continue) strong mask messaging and ensure all retail outlets are requiring masks for entry.\" The report also warns the state that hospitals may be underreporting coronavirus hospitalizations. Pennsylvania Pennsylvania is in the yellow zone for cases and the green zone for test positivity, both stable over the past week. The report says it is \"critical\" that the state work closely with institutions of higher learning \"to develop adequately responsive public health interventions.\" It also recommends expansion of testing, particularly in college and university towns, as well as \"smaller counties where testing is inadequate and the epidemic has been spreading.\" The report also warns the state that hospitals may be underreporting coronavirus hospitalizations. Utah Utah is in the yellow zone for cases and the red zone for test positivity, which the task force warns is the third-highest rate in the country. The state has seen case stability and an increase in test positivity, which the task force describes as \"concerning.\" \"Persistent case rates and slight increase in test positivity are concerning, especially in context of limited testing; recommend clear messaging across the state, especially in areas of elevated or increasing case rates and test positivity,\" the task force recommends, calling on local officials to hold regular public briefings. The report also warns the state that hospitals may be underreporting coronavirus hospitalizations. Vermont Vermont is in the green zone and has the lowest case and test positivity rate in the country, which the task force praises as \"excellent epidemic control.\" Cases have decreased and test positivity is stable over the last week. The report recommends broad guidance for mitigating university spread and encourages the state to \"develop a plan to increase surveillance for silent community spread.\" Washington Washington is in the yellow zone for cases and the green zone for test positivity, with a decrease in new cases and test positivity stability over the past week. The task force did express concern that a \"belt of high incidence and high test positivity counties remain in eastern Washington (especially Whitman, Adams, Grant, and Douglas).\" Whitman County, where Washington State University is located, \"continues to report very high case counts,\" per the report, which issues additional university mitigation recommendations. The report also warns the state that hospitals may be underreporting coronavirus hospitalizations. Wisconsin Wisconsin is in the red zone for cases, the ninth highest rate in the country, and the yellow zone for test positivity, both of which have increased over the last week, per the task force. The task force expresses particular concern with cases in Dane County, home to the University of Wisconsin, which, it says, \"reported more than 1,400 cases last week, a greater than 200% increase.\" The task force repeated its recommendations to institutions of higher learning.   \"The University of Wisconsin-Madison reported sharp increases in the number of students testing positive with more than 1,200 identified during the week ending September 12 in testing conducted both on and off campus. UW-Madison has put 22 fraternity and sorority chapter houses and two large dormitories in quarantine after high rates were detected; large social gatherings had been held at houses despite university rules prohibiting them,\" the task force said. The report also warns the state that hospitals may be underreporting coronavirus hospitalizations.  \n",
            "Label: politics , Text: The disgusting way the Trump campaign is using Brad Parscale's mental health as a political weapon  (CNN)Brad Parscale, who served as campaign manager for President Donald Trump's reelection race until earlier this year, has been hospitalized after an incident at his home in Florida, in which he was reportedly yelling and holding a loaded gun -- causing his wife to flee their home and call the police. According to Parscale's wife, Candice, he had made \"suicidal comments throughout the week\" and she believed he had shot himself.  This is a moment for care and compassion.  Mental illness, although minimized and mocked by this President on a number of occasions, is a very serious problem and it's clear that Parscale is struggling at the moment. (He is not alone in this; according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, almost 44 million Americans experience mental illness in a year.) Which makes the Trump campaign's initial comment on Parscale's hospitalization all the more, well, gross.  \"Brad Parscale is a member of our family and we all love him. We are ready to support him and his family in any way possible,\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement to CNN on Sunday night. \"The disgusting, personal attacks from Democrats and disgruntled RINOs have gone too far, and they should be ashamed of themselves for what they've done to this man and his family.\" (Murtaugh did not elaborate on who he was referencing with that last line). Like I said, gross. Here's the reality. Parscale was fired as campaign manager by Trump, not by \"Democrats and disgruntled RINOs.\" He was removed from his job atop the campaign after Trump's Tulsa rally -- an event the President hoped would signal a glorious return to the campaign trail post Covid-19 -- wound up as a sparsely attended affair that served as a testament to the fact the virus remains uncontrolled in the country. As CNN wrote in mid-July when Parscale was demoted: \"Trump has repeatedly criticized Parscale in meetings over the turnout. Parscale was unaware that he was being demoted until a few hours before the Wednesday night announcement, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.\" And that was far from the first time the President had savaged Parscale. As CNN reported in late April:  \"Within moments, the President was shouting -- not at the aides in the room, but into the phone -- at his campaign manager Brad Parscale, three people familiar with the matter told CNN. Shifting the blame away from himself, Trump berated Parscale for a recent spate of damaging poll numbers, even at one point threatening to sue Parscale. It's not clear how serious the President's threat of a lawsuit was.\" Candice Parscale told police that her husband \"suffers from PTSD.\"  What, exactly, does any of that have to do with \"Democrats and disgruntled RINOs?\" Yes, there has been scrutiny of the way in which Parscale ran the campaign and the decisions he made about how it spent its money. But those are far from \"disgusting personal attacks.\" Rather they are the standard fare of covering campaigns. And, just as a reminder: Trump fired Parscale for just those reasons! The idea that, in the face of the reporting about Parscale's mental troubles -- as well as reported signs that he had become violent with his wife -- the Trump campaign would somehow seek to score political points against Democrats and Republicans who don't back the President is stunning stuff. There are moments that should be beyond politics. This is one of them. The Parscales are clearly in distress. His struggles with his mental health are not political -- or at least shouldn't be. Even Murtaugh seemed to realize how tone-deaf his initial response was, releasing another statement Monday saying simply: \"Our thoughts are with Brad and his family as we wait for all the facts to emerge.\" Better.

            "Text: Killer Mike to receive inaugural Billboard Change Maker Award    (CNN)Rapper and social activist Killer Mike has been announced as the first recipient of the Billboard Change Maker Award. The announcement was made Monday by Dick Clark Productions and NBC which will host the upcoming Billboard Awards. The award \"honors the artist or group that speaks truth to power through their music, celebrity and community.\" \"They are socially conscious, politically aware, active in their community and charitable with time, money and/or influence to improve the lives of others,\" according to a news release about the announcement.  \"Killer Mike's dedication to equality, social justice and financial literacy in the Black community has catapulted him as a headlining figure of social responsibility and activism, as demonstrated in the wake of the slayings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks.\" One half of the hip hop duo Run the Jewels, Killer MIke has spent much of his 20-year music career actively working for social justice and equality including leading voter registration initiatives and helping to create entrepreneurial and educational opportunities for the Black community. \"This award highlights and recognizes the attributes of a true social justice warrior in the field of music who has made exemplary strides to lead the community in positive changemaking advocacy,\" Datwon Thomas, vice president, cultural media at Vibe/MRC Media and consulting producer for the Billboard Music Awards, said in a statement. \"In partnership with a diverse committee of colleagues at MRC and our cultural inclusion committee, BLAC, we selected Killer Mike for his contributions to the current movement and culture and his tangible efforts to make national and grassroots change.\"  The award will be presented to Killer Mike by Atlanta Mayor Kiesha Lance Bottoms, at the APEX (African American Panoramic Experience) Museum in Atlanta.  Hosted by Kelly Clarkson, the 2020 Billboard Music Awards will broadcast live from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Wednesday, at 8 p.m. ET on NBC.    \n",

            "Text: US Supreme Court allows SC vote-by-mail restriction to proceed  (CNN)The Supreme Court on Monday granted a request from South Carolina Republicans to reinstate the state's witness-signature requirement on absentee ballots pending appeal.  The court's order on the first day of its new term is a loss for the Democratic National Committee. There were no noted dissents. The court said, however, that any ballots cast before it had acted, and received within two days of the order, cannot be rejected for failing to comply with the witness requirement. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch indicated they would not have counted those ballots. Your big questions about voting and the 2020 election, answered \"This sends a strong signal that the Supreme Court is going to be wary of federal court-ordered changes close to the election, even those done to deal with burdens on voters created by the pandemic,\" said election law expert Rick Hasen, who serves as a CNN election law analyst. South Carolina law requires that voters casting mail-in absentee ballots swear an oath that they are qualified to vote and they received no assistance in voting when they seal and sign their ballots, and that oath must be witnessed by one other person, who must sign below the voter's signature. Democrats challenged the provision, arguing that because of the coronavirus outbreak there is \"overwhelming and unrefuted evidence, that as applied during the pandemic, the witness requirement increases the risk of Covid-19 infection and transmission and unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote.\" A lower court blocked the requirement. Mail-in vs. absentee voting: What's the difference? Republicans argued to the Supreme Court that more than 150,000 absentee ballots \"have been mailed out already, and each passing day increases the risk that ballots will be returned, that, in mistaken reliance on the district court's injunction, do not comply with the witness requirement.\" They said, \"Although COVID-19 might make in-person voting less desirable, courts cannot hold private citizens' decisions to stay home for their own safety against the State.\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained why he had voted in favor of the Republicans. He said a state legislature's decision either to \"keep or to make changes to election rules to address COVID-19 ordinarily should not be subject to second-guessing by an unelected federal judiciary\" and that the court has repeatedly emphasized that federal courts should not alter state election rules too close to an election. He said the lower court \"defied that principle.\"  \n",

            "Text: 'Homemade' directors share how the series came together amid quarantine   (CNN)Director Pablo Larraín had an idea for Netflix -- a collection of short films made by various actors and directors during quarantine amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  The series, titled \"Homemade,\" features 17 short films that viewers can watch in any order. The five to ten minute shorts are meant to portray the shared experience of lockdown across the world. Directors were told they could use only equipment they had at home, with many shooting their films on their phone and using whoever they were quarantined with as actors.  CNN spoke to three of the directors about their vision and execution. 'A classic set up' Antonio Campos, who was directing \"The Devil All the Time\" when Covd-19 hit, switched gears to make a \"Homemade\" short. Called \"Annex,\" in which a family finds an unconscious man on the beach and takes him home. The man begins to multiply, \"much like the coronavirus,\" Campos told CNN. It was filmed in Springs, New York, near the ocean.  \"We live in Brooklyn and my wife and my one-year-old son, three days into quarantine we were already starting to feel claustrophobic,\" he said. They quarantined in March with a few other filmmaker friends, who also helped write and act in the movie.  Campos said the process began over dinner, where the group would kick around about ideas. \"We have the house, we have us, and we have an iPhone, right?\" Campos recalled. \"So what can we do? We were near the water and we have this great actor, Chris Abbott. We started to sort of throw ideas around, like what if there was this guy who shows up at the house, this is kind of a classic idea, stranger shows up and then things get weird. That's just kind of a classic set up.\" He filmed it over the course of about a week, adding the shoot was \"something that we had to do in between our day jobs.\"  The group would look at footage at night, edit, and decide what was needed for the next day.  \"We also had our collaborators that were helping us remotely,\" Campos added. \"We had a sound mixer that we had worked with, and then our composers who were composing music for my feature film, they took it and they ran with it. And then our color timer, that was a phone call. It became a little house kind of like a film factory.\" 'an unexpected gift' \"Bend It Like Beckham\" writer Gurinder Chadha made her \"Homemade\" short, titled \"Unexpected Gift,\" while quarantining in London with her husband and her 13-year-old twins, Kumiko and Ronak. She said she wanted to show quarantine from her kids' point of view.  \"[At first] I said, I can't think of anything worth making a film about in lock down, because everyone else is going through that right now and who wants to watch other people [do that]. So I declined then, but the next day my husband was sort of sat at the computer and the call from the company came and we had been in lockdown for about six weeks by then. And I film everything. And then what was becoming very clear was that it was about the kids and about the kids' perspective. And that's when the film came together.\" The short shows her immediate family spending time together, playing video games and cooking.  \"I had been shooting lots of videos with my kids from the start of lockdown, because I love to document them growing and changing. Our time during lockdown was incredible for our family and ran the gamut from joy and silliness to having to process family members dying,\" Chadha told CNN. \"My editors in Italy were fabulous and we cut the film together remotely. We got it down to 12 minutes and Netflix was very supportive of filmmakers following their own vision of what this experience has meant to them.\" She said she conducted a two-week shoot and then took another two weeks to edit. Her final cut was nine minutes.  \"For me and my family, this time has genuinely been an unexpected gift,\" Chadha said. 'A letter of hope'  Rachel Morrison created her short, \"The Lucky Ones,\" using footage of her five-year-old son playing, set to Morrison's voice reading a letter of hope.  \"I conceived the idea for the film around a lot of stills and video I had already taken on my iPhone but then spent about a week shooting additional footage on my DSLRs,\" Morrison explained. \"I spent about two to three weeks editing, first locking it with a voiceover actress but then realizing it was so personal that I had to reopen the cut and use my own voice instead.\" The final edit, matched with music and additional new footage, worked for Morrison. \"My goal was to have certain moments line up with the words, while leaving others less literal,\" Morrison told CNN.  While she was on the road weeks later, Morrison's wife showed it to their son, Wiley.  \"I'm not sure how much he understood but he told me he liked it,\" she said. \"His first question was whether his best buddy, Indy, would be able to see him on TV.\"  \n",

            "Text: A vaccine can provide better immunity than an actual infection. Here's why.  The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.  (CNN)Two recent studies have confirmed that two people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can be reinfected with the virus.  Interestingly, the two people had different outcomes. The person in Hong Kong showed no symptoms on the second infection, while the person from Reno, Nevada, had a more severe version of the disease the second time around. It is therefore unclear if an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will protect against subsequent reinfection. Does this mean a vaccine will also fail to protect against the virus? Certainly not. First, it is still unclear how common these reinfections are. More importantly, a fading immune response to natural infection, as seen in the Nevada patient, does not mean we cannot develop a successful, protective vaccine. READ MORE: Big pharma's safety pledge isn't enough to build public confidence in a vaccine Any infection initially activates a non-specific innate immune response, in which white blood cells trigger inflammation. This may be enough to clear the virus. But in more prolonged infections, the adaptive immune system is activated. Here, T and B cells recognise distinct structures (or antigens) derived from the virus. T cells can detect and kill infected cells, while B cells produce antibodies that neutralize the virus. During a primary infection -- that is, the first time a person is infected with a particular virus -- this adaptive immune response is delayed. It takes a few days before immune cells that recognize the specific pathogen are activated and expanded to control the infection. Some of these T and B cells, called memory cells, persist long after the infection is resolved. It is these memory cells that are crucial for long-term protection. In a subsequent infection by the same virus, the memory cells get activated rapidly and induce a robust and specific response to block the infection. A vaccine mimics this primary infection, providing antigens that prime the adaptive immune system and generating memory cells that can be activated rapidly in the event of a real infection. However, as the antigens in the vaccine are derived from weakened or noninfectious material from the virus, there is little risk of severe infection. READ MORE: A man in Hong Kong caught Covid-19 twice. Here's why that's not surprising   A better immune response Vaccines have other advantages over natural infections. For one, they can be designed to focus the immune system against specific antigens that elicit better responses. For instance, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine elicits a stronger immune response than infection by the virus itself. One reason for this is that the vaccine contains high concentrations of a viral coat protein, more than what would occur in a natural infection. This triggers strongly neutralizing antibodies, making the vaccine very effective at preventing infection. The natural immunity against HPV is especially weak, as the virus uses various tactics to evade the host immune system. Many viruses, including HPV, have proteins that block the immune response or simply lie low to avoid detection. Indeed, a vaccine that provides accessible antigens in the absence of these other proteins may allow us to control the response in a way that a natural infection does not. READ MORE: Why young people should be prioritized for Covid-19 vaccinations  The immunogenicity of a vaccine -- that is, how effective it is at producing an immune response -- can also be fine tuned. Agents called adjuvants typically kick-start the immune response and can enhance vaccine immunogenicity. Alongside this, the dose and route of administration can be controlled to encourage appropriate immune responses in the right places. Traditionally, vaccines are administered by injection into the muscle, even for respiratory viruses such as measles. In this case, the vaccine generates such a strong response that antibodies and immune cells reach the mucosal surfaces in the nose. However, the success of the oral polio vaccine in reducing infection and transmission of polio has been attributed to a localised immune response in the gut, where poliovirus replicates. Similarly, delivering the coronavirus vaccine directly to the nose may contribute to a stronger mucosal immunity in the nose and lungs, offering protection at the site of entry. READ MORE: Herd immunity won't solve America's Covid-19 problem  Understanding natural immunity is key A good vaccine that improves upon natural immunity requires us to first understand our natural immune response to the virus. So far, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been detected up to four months after infection. Previous studies have suggested that antibodies against related coronaviruses typically last for a couple of years. However, declining antibody levels do not always translate to weakening immune responses. And more promisingly, a recent study found that memory T cells triggered responses against the coronavirus that causes Sars almost two decades after the people were infected. Of the roughly 320 vaccines being developed against Covid-19, one that favors a strong T cell response may be the key to long-lasting immunity. n Maitreyi Shivkumar is a senior lecturer in molecular biology at De Montfort University.
